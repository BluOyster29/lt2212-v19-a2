<h1>Name: Robert Rhys Thomas</h1> 

Additional instructions
At the moment simdoc is all automated, I have removed the argparse just for convenience. All the vector files are attached in the zip file. I have some issues with cosine simularity and I am still working on this. 



<ul>To Do
  <li>- Doc Strings</li>
  <li>- Cosine Simularity </li>
  <li>- String formatting </li>
  <li>- Tidying up </li>
</ul>

Estimated completion - by end of week

<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>All of these have been completed. I am a little concered about the data about for tfidf however. </p>

<h4>File naming convention</h4>
All filenames are easily legible in the zip file

<h4>Results and discussion:</h4>

<h4>Vocabulary restriction:</h4>
<p>For vocabulary restriction I have removed stop words, these are words that are very common such as 'the' and 'a'. These words do not really give any meaning and will be very common which could give us false information. </p>
